When this card is activated: You can send one \"SunShine\" card from your hand to the GY, and target one \"SunShine\" card on the field; shuffle that target into the Deck then send the top card of your Deck to the GY. You can send one \"SunShine\" card you control to the GY; send all Spell cards on the field to the GY, except \"SunShine Death Valley\". If this card is in your GY, you can banish this card; banish a Field Spell your opponent controls. You can only use each effect of \"SunShine Death Valley\" once per turn.",
