You can target 1 \"SunShine\" monster you control; this turn, it can make a second attack, but damage your opponent takes from battles involving that monster is halved. If this card is sent to the GY: You can target 1 \"SunShine\" card on the field, banish it; then banish 1 card from your opponent's field, or GY. If this card is in your GY, except the turn it is sent there, you can banish this card; send 1 card your opponent controls to the GY. You can only use each effect of \"SunShine Blindness'' once per turn.",
