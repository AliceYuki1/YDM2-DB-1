You can Fusion Summon 1 \"Koala\" Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck by shuffling the Fusion Materials listed on it into the Deck, from among the monsters in your GY and/or your face-up banished cards. If a \"Koala\" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this face-up card you control instead. You can only use each effect of \"Koala Tree\" once per turn.",
